# Massa

This app allows users to split a large file ( or a torrent ) and separately download each block in different devices and combined them back to create the original files locally.

There are 2 major uses for this application 1) One person can use multiple internet connections and multiple devices to download a file faster. 2) Multiple people with low bandwidth (low data packages) can download a larger file that is useful to all of them. Ex: Fedora DVD for set of Linux enthusiasts.
